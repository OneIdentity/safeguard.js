# AGENTS.md — @oneidentity/safeguard

TypeScript SDK for the One Identity Safeguard Web API. The repo targets Node.js (server automation, A2A, certificate auth, SignalR) and browsers (PKCE, session-backed auth, ESM bundle).

## Project Structure

- `src/index.ts` — Node entry point with A2A, cert auth, HTTP, and events exports
- `src/browser.ts` — browser-safe entry point without Node-only modules
- `src/client.ts` — `SafeguardClient`
- `src/auth/` — auth strategies (`PasswordAuth`, `CertificateAuth`, PKCE, token, anonymous)
- `src/a2a/` — `A2AClient`, broker types, SSH key formats
- `src/events/` — `SafeguardEventListener` and `PersistentSafeguardEventListener`
- `src/http/` — `NodeHttpClient` and `BrowserHttpClient`
- `src/storage/` — memory and browser session storage providers
- `tests/unit/` — pure logic tests
- `tests/integration/` — live appliance tests
- `samples/` — Node and browser usage examples
- `pipeline-templates/` and `azure-pipelines.yml` — build/release automation
- `.agents/skills/` — on-demand repo skills

## Setup and Build

```bash
npm ci
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

Use Node.js 20+ locally; CI runs on Node 22.

## Linting

```bash
npm run lint
npm run format:check
```

## Testing

```bash
npm run test
npm run test:integration
```

Integration tests use a live appliance and expect `SPP_HOST` plus related `SPP_*` credentials.

## Code Conventions

- Keep TypeScript strict; avoid `any` unless justified
- Treat auth as pluggable strategy objects with no global state
- Use async/await and Promise-based APIs only
- Throw typed SDK errors (`ApiError`, `TransportError`, `ConfigurationError`, etc.)
- Wrap secrets in `SecretValue`; only call `.expose()` at the point of use
- Preserve platform separation: Node-only code stays out of `src/browser.ts`
- Avoid side effects at import time; constructors should not perform I/O

## CI/CD

For pipeline flow, version stamping, npm publish, and release details, load [build-and-release](.agents/skills/build-and-release/SKILL.md).

## Security

- Never commit secrets, tokens, certificates, or private keys
- Keep TLS verification enabled in production; `verify: false` is lab-only
- Prefer in-memory tokens and avoid browser persistence unless the caller explicitly accepts the XSS tradeoff
- Validate host handling and optional peer dependencies when changing auth, HTTP, or SignalR code

## Versioning

Do not hand-edit `package.json` version. Release versioning is derived from git tags; `main` builds publish prereleases and `v*` tags publish stable packages.

## Keeping this file current

- Keep this file short, broadly applicable, and always-on
- Move detailed workflows into `.agents/skills/`
- Update the skills table when adding, removing, or renaming a skill
- Prefer one-line pointers here for deep CI/CD or operational detail
